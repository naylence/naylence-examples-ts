# Delivery Examples (TypeScript)

This section replicates the delivery semantics walkthroughs from the Python repository. Focus areas include crash recovery and retry-on-ack failures.

Examples:

- `agent-crash-recovery/`
- `retry-on-no-ack-received/`

Each example will receive TypeScript agents, clients, and Compose files mirroring the Python originals.

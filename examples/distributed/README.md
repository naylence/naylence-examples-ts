# Distributed Examples (TypeScript)

This section will replicate the Python `distributed/` tour: start with a single sentinel + agent pair and grow into multi-agent, multi-sentinel fabrics with delivery guarantees.

## Planned subfolders

- `hello/`
- `hello-with-sentinel/`
- `rpc/`
- `cancellable/`
- `status-subscription/`
- `push-notifications/`
- `capability-routing/`
- `multi-agent/`
- `biomes/`
- `peers/`
- `stateful-conversation/`

Each folder will contain Docker Compose files, environment scaffolding, and TypeScript entrypoints mirroring the Python walkthrough.
